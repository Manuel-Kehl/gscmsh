gscmsh - GetSimple CMS Shell 
============================

A simple shell script to comfortably execute certain maintenance operations, 
like installing plugins or themes for the GetSimple CMS.
The overall aim is to provide a workflow that is similar to Drupal's drush.

As I have just startet writing this, it is not capabale of doing much yet. 
The possible options so far are installing and listing plugins and themes.
The script hast to be executed from within somewhere in the website's directory tree.

Be careful, as this has just been written and may contain fatal bugs capable of bricking your website :P
Use at your own risk and always have a backup ready!


In case you want to join development I will attach a list of features that I would love to see implemented:
- quick backup (should not be too complicated, as there is no DB involved)
- update core files
- fix common file system permission problems
- anything cool, that you can think of ;-)
- Autocomplete based on possible actions and installed themes/plugins



I hope this is may be of help for someone. 
Have fun and spread the word ;-)
